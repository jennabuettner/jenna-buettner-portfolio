    <h1> about </h1>
    <p>Hard working, driven, and well-versed in the technologies of software engineering, I am confident that I can surpass your expectations for your company's internet presence both technically and visually. While I am proficient in the matter of developing web and mobile applications, I am also an experienced artist of several forms. As a result, excellent visual presentation within my work is essential to meeting not just yours but my own self-expectations. 
    In regard to my personal hobbies, I am a self-trained seamstress and quilt-maker, as well as a home-chef, and multi-media artist. Because each of these activities rely heavily on both technical and creative proficiency, they are methods that I have come to apply to every variety of work that I produce. In addition, I have over 9 years of experience as a Flight Attentdant, providing me with a dynamic mastery of customer service, facing issues head on, and quickly settling on a solution that is universally pleasing.</p>
